			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img id="headshot" src="assets/images/NDavisPicture.jpg" alt="Picture of Nathaniel">
				<p>I'm an aspiring web developer, currently enrolled in a full stack bootcamp at the University of North Carolina Charlotte, with an expected graduation in November 2017. I'm originally from Vermont, and I graduated Eckerd College in Florida with my B.A. in Communication in 2012. I have a currently work in broadcast television advertising, and I do voiceover work as a hobby. I'm very excited to learn as much as I can about web development and design in the next 6 months, and transition from my current career into a collaborative, creative role in the field.</p>
			
				<p>I'll be updating my portfolio page with some of my projects as the course progresses. In the meantime, feel free to connect with me.</p>
